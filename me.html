										<h2>General info</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I live in Vancouver, Canada. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. I enjoy working with people who view programming as both an artistic and scientific endeavour. I use they/them pronouns online (in person they might be different). I like cats. I like reading. I like computers.<br></p>

												<h3>Programming</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I taught myself how to program in elementary school. I taught myself PHP and started working with PocketMine, the company which creates server software for Minecraft Pocket Edition. I built the majority of the plugins for Minecraft Pocket Edition servers, which have amassed millions of downloads. I was hired by several of the largest server companies to work on their servers.</p>
											<p>Then I learned Javascript and NodeJS and started building a variety of web apps and working with local theatre companies to develop marketing tools. Last year, I developed a gameification system for my high school. Now I am getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and trying to find projects which I am passionate about. I know Javascript, PHP, Java, some C, and some Lisp. I have extensive experience with NodeJS, Mongo, and AngularJS.</p>

												<h3>Team management and Customer Service</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I have experience coordinating and working with remote teams. I competed in my first Hackathon with a completely remote team (Canada, Taiwan, and Australia) and our team was a finalist. I also co-founded and was co-preseident of the Computer Science club at my school and coordinated our first Hour of Code event.</p>
											<p>I enjoy helping clients solve problems. I pride myself in the support I provide to the users of my software. I have experience moderating content at the Minecraft Forum, PocketMine forums, Wikipedia, and Minecraft Seeds. Each of those sites has millions of users and delivering effective customer support is a fast paced and difficult job. </p>

												<h3>Literature</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I like literature a lot. I have read a ton of books and I hope to read a ton more. My favourite right now is "The Shadow of the Wind".</p>
											<p>I have a passion for Shakespeare. I have volunteered for the Shakespeare festival in my city for the past three years and I have been taking classes there for the past five years. I have played roles such as Henry V and Horatio. You can probably find some pictures of me online wearing various costumes. </p>

											<ul>
												<li><a href="https://github.com/ocws">I built a website to store all of Shakespeare's plays in a new and accessible XML, that's on GitHub.</a></li>
												<li>I built an app from my local Shakespeare festival to engage audience members.</li>
												<li>I designed the tabulation and executed the tabulation of hundreds of surveys for Bard on the Beach.</li>
												<li><a href="https://github.com/Falkirks/lear-lear-lear/blob/master/lear-project-essay.md">I made a cute visualition and wrote an essay about the social order in King Lear.</a></li>
